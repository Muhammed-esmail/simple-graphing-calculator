# simple-graphing-calculator
A simple python-made graphing calculator. Used tkinter for GUI.

I made 2 versions of this idea that I got.
After getting an introduction to tkinter for making GUIs and the power of the "eval" function, I was like "Ya know what? I think I have the tools to make a graphing calculator." And so I did.

I am sharing this because I think it's really cool and to learn from any changes anyone makes to it.

I didn't write any comments, which is bad I know, but the idea is very basic. It's just a bunch of buttons at the bottom and it draws the graph by plotting alot of points on it. Taking the input from the user is the most difficult part.

Any improvements I believe would be to the input, how it draws and how to make it smoother without plotting a million points.

There already are libraries that make graphs in python, but c'mon. Where's the fun in that?
